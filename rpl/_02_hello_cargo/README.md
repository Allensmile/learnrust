# First Cargo Program

* You can create a similar directory by typing:

  ```bash
  cargo new _02_hello_cargo
  ```

* This command creates a [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) file, click on its link to read it for more details.

* Then, start writing code in [src/main.rs](src/main.rs).

* Cargo.lock is for fixing the crate (aka: _package in other langs_) versions.

* See [this](/notes/tips.md#cargo) to understand how to run a program using Cargo.
